        <p>Charlotte Core is a hybrid operating system kernel developed as a part of CharlotteOS.</p>
      
        <h3 id="status">Status</h3>
      
        <p>Charlotte Core is in very early development. Run it at your own risk.</p>
      
        <h3 id="implementation-languages">Implementation Languages</h3>
        
        <p>Charlotte Core is written in Rust and Assembly language</p>
        
        <h3 id="target-platforms">Target Platforms</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>x86-64 PCs with UEFI and ACPI (In Progress)</li>
            <li>Aarch64 devices with UEFI and ACPI (In Progress)</li>
            <li>RISC-V devices with UEFI and ACPI (Not under active development yet)</li>

        <p>When you first clone this respository make sure to run the following commands to ensure that the git submodules are initialized and up to date:</p>
        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git submodule init
        git submodule update
        </code></pre></div></div>
        
        <h4 id="building">Building</h4>
        <p>The following commands are used to build the debug and release versions of the kernel.</p>
        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>make build-x86_64-debug    <span class="c"># debug</span>
        make build-x86_64-release  <span class="c"># release</span>
        </code></pre></div></div>
        <h4 id="testing">Testing</h4>
        
        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>make run-x86_64-debug    <span class="c"># For testing a debug build in qemu</span>
        make run-x86_64-release  <span class="c"># For testing a release build in qemu</span>
        </code></pre></div></div>
        
        <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x86_64</code> portion of any of the previous commands can be replaced with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aarch64</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">riscv64</code> to build the kernel for the Arm and RISC-V architectures respectively however it should be noted that support for these ISAs is much less complete
        than for x86_64 for the time being.</p>
        
        <h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
        
        <p>Detailed documentation will eventually be available on the projectâ€™s wiki and website.</p>
